## Transition Pathways

### Snapshot Models

::: {.callout-note}
#### Definition

- operate on consecutive _snapshots_ ("= time steps") of a system
- for each, all input data can be specified
- often make use of (multi-) hourly snapshots
- often span a single, full year
:::

::: {.callout-tip}
#### Properties
- are "easy" to describe mathematically
- provide insights into the energy system for individual years
- lack the ability to depict dynamics in investment strategies throughout a transition period
:::

## Transition Pathways

### Transition / Pathway Models

::: {.callout-note}
#### Definition
- can be seen as extension to snapshot models
- represent the entire transition pathway to a long term target
:::

::: {.callout-tip}
#### Properties
- can be "hard" to describe mathematically
- provide insights into the energy system over a period of many years
- quickly become computationally intractable
- are not fully supported by many tools

## Algorithms: An Overview

Overview, ToC

### Simulation

Simulation models, especially agent-based (ABM) ones, can be

- used to simulate large periods of time, while keeping computational complexity (somewhat) under control;
- used to study investment decisions that profit-seeking investors might choose, in contrast to often-assumed central planning;
- "easily" linked to other topics, like risk aversion, social acceptance, learning curves, ...

**Soft coupling:** Coupling ABMs with optimization models can not only be done by considering agents that solve optimization problems, but also via (iterative) soft coupling.

### Myopic Paths

::: {.callout-note}
### Approach
- picks a number of modeling years
- intializes the model for the first year, and optimizes it
- uses the results of that run as initialization of the next year's model
:::

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
**Advantages:**

- allow decommissioning between years
- are "easy" to configure with input data
- can overlap years (similar to MPC)
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
**Disadvantages:**

- prone to lock-in effects
- assume intra-year perfect foresight
- "budget" constraints must be provided

## Conventional Optimization

### Reducing the Model Resolution - (I)

::: {.callout-tip}
#### Direct reduction of model resolution
Examples: Either reduce the temporal resolution from $n$- to $m$-hourly ($m > n$) blocks, or reduce the spatial resolution (e.g., via clustering).
:::

::: {.callout-tip}
#### Variable resolutions
Examples: Extend the simple reduction to account for higher details (temporal and spatial) during important periods (e.g., extreme events).

## Conventional Optimization

### Reducing the Model Resolution - (II)

::: {.callout-note}
#### Representative periods
Instead of modeling each snapshot, a _representative period_ presumes that some periods throughout the year are highly similar to others, and therefore need not be modelled individually. Periods are often _days or weeks_.
:::

::: {.callout-caution}
#### Interdependencies
While many approaches target a reduction of interdependencies between distinct periods - myopic paths are a high-level example of that - representative periods initially increase the temporal coupling of a model.
:::

However, without any inter-temporal constraints, models immediately decompose into their representative periods, that can be recombined (e.g., using weights).

## Conventional Optimization

### Reducing the Model Resolution - (III)

**Fixing cyclic states:** For small scale storages, it can be argued that this cyclic behaviour occurs more often, e.g., each week, or even day. Assuming that each cyclic period is constrained to the same initial state of charge (e.g., 50%) immediately leads to decoupled periods.

**Foregoing per-snapshot decisions:** Assuming that demand and generation behave "identical" for time periods that are similar, all decision variables - except those related to _states_ (e.g., storages) - can be dropped and replaced by their representative.

**Mixed temporal resolutions:** With a similar argument, temporal granularity of decision variables can be reduced, e.g., by modeling renewables in hourly resolution, and nuclear plants in congruent 8-hour blocks. _This may not be studied enough to actually gauge whether it's actually an improvement._

**Complex inter-period behaviour:** Many modern frameworks apply a formulation of seasonal storages, that summarizes intra-period states, properly respecting upper/lower storage bounds, while dropping decision variables based on representative periods.

https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2018.01.023

<!--
Cyclic states roughly require

$$
\begin{aligned}
state_{t+1} & = state_t + charge_t - discharge_t \qquad & \forall t \in T \setminus \{last\} \\
state_1 & = state_{last} + charge_{last} - discharge_{last} & 
\end{aligned}
$$

linking the whole model. For small scale storages, it can be argued that this cyclic behaviour occurs more often, e.g., each week, or even day. Assuming that each cyclic period is constrained to the same initial state of charge (e.g., 50%) immediately leads to decoupled periods.

### General

::: {.callout-warning}
#### The main challenges

- seasonal storages (or budget constraints)
- depiction of investments via annuities or lump-sum payments
- salvage/residual values, or: _"Are assets assets or burdens?"_
- end of horizon effects, or: _"Is there a world after 2050?"_

![Total annual system cost](img/obj.png)

![Load shedding](img/shedding.png)

Comparison of high-level results: Load shedding results are almost identical, and only occur in later years (assumption: reduced costs due to the introduction of DSR products). The total annual system cost is slightly higher for PW (expected!), which even leads to a solution that could be considered near-optimal. Overheads in 2050 are caused by no decommissioning assumption in the simplified example.
